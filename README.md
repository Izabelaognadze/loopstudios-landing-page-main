## Overview

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, You need a good understanding of HTML, SASS and a basic understanding of JavaScript.**

### The challenge
My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & SASS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
